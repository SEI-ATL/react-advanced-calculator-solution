## ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/python-ga/images/GA_Cog_Medium_White_RGB.png) Advanced React Calculator

Remember the calculator we made during the in-class lab? Well, let's take it to the next level! 

Let's try building an app like the one that comes default on your Mac.

## Prerequisites

You will need to know the following concepts before attempting this challenge:

* ES6 Arrow Functions
* React events (such as onClick)
* React State

## Requirements and Planning Process

You will need to implement the following:

* AC (Clear) button (clear the state)
* 4 main operators `+ - / *` (store operator in state)
* 0-9 buttons (store numerical value in state)
* Equals button (evaluate the answer based on your state)
* Error messages if the user makes a mistake (such as trying to use two operators)
* Basic styling to match the Mac built-in app 
    * Orange operator buttons
    * Dark gray display
    * Light gray number buttons


## Steps and Set Up

* `Fork` and `Clone` this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to see your basic create-react-app boilerplate
* Implement the requirements above and one or more of the bonuses if you have time
* Push the code back up to your fork
* Make a pull request against the base fork 
* ðŸŽ‰ CelebrateÂ ðŸŽ‰

## Bonus

Choose any of the following:

* Alter your app's logic for the `-` operator to allow negative numbers to be input
* Implement the +/- button that switches a number from negative to positive or vice versa
* Implement the `%` button.
    * As a modulus operator
    * Like it is on the Mac program (just divides current number by 100)
* Implement the floating point `.` button in order to support decimals. 
    * Don't allow more than one decimal per number!
